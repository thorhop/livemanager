// The point of this JS file is to contain the functions
// that will parse ALS files, rounding up chords played
// and concluding which keys and scales are being used

// Here we will implement 'music-helper' to convert
// numeric MIDI code in to keys, which will be combined
// with note time to assert what chords are being played.
